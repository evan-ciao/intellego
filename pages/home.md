## about
The goal of this personal archive is to build a reliable [zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) that can withstand the wearing of time.

Markdown pages are the building blocks of the archive. Each page must be self-contained and encapsulate knowledge aphoristically and simply.
Intellego is a tool for thought, and the context in which pages are read or written is much more important than their topic or category.

> “In the old system, the question is: Under which topic do I store this note? In the new system, the question is: In which context will I want to stumble upon it again?”
